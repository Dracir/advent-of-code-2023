# Streaming goal

- I want *no* bits, subs, whatever money. This is a test stream for fun, no pressure.
- If it goes well, I will improve the scenes.
- The pre-stream scene is to show a bit the direction I want to go :).

# My Advent of Code 2023 Goals

- Solve *fun* days in pure c#
- We maybe try to use stupid / funny way to solve
- Not aiming for fastest / shortest / perfectest solutions

## Options
- use a day challenge to create fun rendering in Godot
- Solve a few challenges with compute shaders
- Code in vim ( when my config is completed )

## Rules
- No spoiling of Part 2
- Give me a little time of reading and talking about it, before tell me about the fancy theorem that solve the problem in no time.
